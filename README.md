# Test automate release

- Lint for commits
- Commit messages
- Circle CI for continuous integration
- And automatic release on push to master or by merging a pull request or merging from another branch

## Getting Started

Let me show you how to do it.

### Lint for commits

- [commitlint](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint)

First, it is necessary [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky#readme)

```
npm install husky --save-dev
```

letÂ´s go to install commitlint

```
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/{config-conventional,cli}
```

and add in package.json

```javascript
// package.json
"husky": {
  "hooks": {
    "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
  }
}
```

#### Test to commitlint

```javascript
git commit -m "foo: test failed" // fail
git commit -m "fix: test ok" // ok
```
